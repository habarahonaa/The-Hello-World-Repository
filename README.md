# The Hello World Repository
With Github downloading every repository to store them in a vault in the North Pole, here's a compilation of "Hello World" programs in various programming languages, to be preserved for hundreds of years.

## Why?
Why not? Github will store in a secure vault all the existing repositories the 2nd of February 2020 (2/2/2020). I thought it would be a good idea to store the first piece of code everyone writes when learning programming in multiple languages. That way, future generations will be able to read about old languages and find about programming history.
