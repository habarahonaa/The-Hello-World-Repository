# The-Hello-World-Repository
With Github downloading every repository to store them in a vault in the North Pole, here's one with "Hello World" programs written in multiple programming languages.

## Why?
Why not? Github will store in a secure vault all the existing repositories the 2nd of February 2020 (2/2/2020). I thought it would be a good idea to store the first piece of code everyone writes when learning programming in multiple languages.
